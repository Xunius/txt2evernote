# The role of horizontal resolution in simulating drivers of the global hydrological cycle

	> AGCMs from the UK Met Officce Hadley Centre: HadGEM1-A at resolutions ranging from
	270 to 60 km and HadGEM3-A ranging from 135 to 25 km. ...... The models exhibit
	a stable hydrological cycle, although too intense compared to reanalyses and
	observations. This overintensity is explained by excess surface shortwave
	radiation, a common error in general circulation models (GCMs). ......
	resolution is increased, precipitation decreases over the ocean and increases
	over the land. ...... his is associated with an increase in atmospheric
	moisture transport from ocean to land, which changes the partitioning of
	moisture fluxes

# Changes in precipitation with climate change

	> Hence, storms, whether individual thunderstorms, extratropical rain or snow
	storms, or tropical cyclones, supplied with increased moisture, produce more
	intense precipitation events. ...... With modest changes in winds, patterns of
	precipitation do not change much, but result in dry areas becoming drier
	(generally throughout the subtropics) and wet areas becoming wetter, especially
	in the mid- to high latitudes: with more precipitation per unit of upward
	motion in the atmosphere, ...... , atmospheric circulation weakens, causing
	monsoons to falter. Most models simulate precipitation that occurs prematurely
	and too often, and with insufficient intensity, resulting in recycling that is
	too large and a lifetime of moisture in the atmosphere that is too short, which
	affects runoff and soil moisture

# Multisource Estimation of Long-Term Terrestrial Water Budget for Major Global River Basins

	> For evapotranspiration, in-situ-based estimates rely on networks of flux towers.
	Although these networks are very sparse globally, progress has been made in
	upscaling flux tower estimates to global coverage (Jung et al. 2009). Large-
	scale estimates can also be derived from remote sensing using satellite-
	retrieved radiation fluxes and surface meteorological conditions. The retrieval
	is usually performed using an empirically based, process-based, or energy
	balance model of boundary layer fluxes, such as the Penman Monteith (PM),
	Priestly Taylor (PT), or the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) models (Su
	2002) upscaled flux tower-based dataset from the Max Planck Institute (MPI) (
